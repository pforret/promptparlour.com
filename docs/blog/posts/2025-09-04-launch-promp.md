After some weeks of exploring existing communities, I have decided to launch my own community around A.I. technology, applications and society.

> As an engineer, I am excited, then as well as now. As a father, as a citizen, I am worried. The pace of change is breathtaking, and I am not sure we as a society are ready for it. Exponential growth is hard to grasp.

> My friends know I have been talking about A.I. for a long time: the technology, the applications, the impact on jobs and society. I have been mostly a missionary, sometimes a sceptic. I am now looking for other missionaries, entrepreneurs, sceptics and curious people. This thing is big. We need to talk about it.

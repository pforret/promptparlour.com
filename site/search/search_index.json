As a father, as a citizen, I am worried. The pace of change is breathtaking, and I am not sure we as a society are ready for it. Exponential growth is hard to grasp.</p> <p>My friends know I have been talking about A.I. for a long time: the technology, the applications, the impact on jobs and society.

We need to talk about it.</p> <p>via blog.forret.com</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/launch/","title":"launch","text":""}]}
